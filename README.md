Currently, I have used [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)

   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv env
   $ source env/bin/activate
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
If you have any errors with pip, try the following:

   ```bash
   $ pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install --upgrade setuptools
   ```

For using jupyter notebook:

```bash
   $ pip install notebook
   $ jupyter notebook
```

And open correct notebook
